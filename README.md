# Multi-Currency Money

## Purpose
The goal of this demonstration is to show step by step how TDD works by building a module responsible for handling multiple money currencies together (We will only handle sum and multiplication) as show in the book [TDD by Example](https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Development-Addison-Wesley-Signature-2002-11-08/dp/B017PO61ME/) by Kent Beck. 

## How this works
This git repository will reproduce every step described in the book by using commits, a single step representing one commit.
So, to see the flow of how this works, you will need to browse this repository commit by commit.
Also, to make things easier for you, the title of each commit will be prefixed with either Red, Green or Refactor depending on which step of TDD we are in.

You will find in the TODO.md file the list of things to do that is updated at every step.
